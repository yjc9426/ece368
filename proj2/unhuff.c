/*  ECE368 Project 2: Huffman Compression and Decompression

*
*   Description:
*           This is the main program for the Huffman Decompression algorithm.
*       The program takes one (1) command line argument, which is the file to
*       be decompressed. The algorithm uses Huffman coding to decompress the
*		input file, and stores the decompressed file as 
*		<filename.extension>.unhuff
